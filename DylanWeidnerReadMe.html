This is a practice project I made following the Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru course on Udemy.

I made this project following the first 2 sections of the course. It is a basic program that utilizes an in memory
database for persistence.

If you run the program. You will see a count of the number of books, authors, and publishers on the command line.
You can also travel to localhost:8080/authors and localhost:8080/books to get information on the books and authors.
